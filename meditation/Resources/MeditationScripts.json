Notice the support beneath you, the steadying presence of the floor or chair. With each exhale, allow the day to loosen its grip. Inhale calm. Exhale what you are ready to release. Stay here, breathing steadily, arriving fully into this moment."

Invite the chest and belly to release. Soften the hips, the thighs, the knees. Let the relaxation flow all the way to your ankles and feet. You are safe here. The body knows how to rest."
